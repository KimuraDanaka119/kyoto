# Additional notes

## Dealing with Go packages

I'm still working on this :)

## Downsides of the library

- Pretty complex and hard to understand setup
- There is no option to provide "Quick Start" as far as library created for complex setup
- Actions feature sometimes is hard to use due to [downsides](/docs/extended-features/#ssa-limitations)
- As far as Actions feature relies on server side code, network connection is quite important
- Not so feature-rich as modern frontend frameworks, as far as library tries to solve another issues
