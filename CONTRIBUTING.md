# Contributing to kyoto

I will be as brief as possible

- If you're new to `kyoto`, you can take some issues with `good first issue` label as introduction to the library code
- You can use `examples/demo` project to test and debug your changes
- If you're making changes in payload code, you'll need to run `npm run dynamics:build && npm run dynamics:pack` after each payload change. These commands are responsible for building and packing TS code to Golang file(s) 
- The code may be of poor quality. Feel free to open new Issues/PRs for improving a project
- In case of any questions, you can:
  - leave a comment inside of Issue 
  - ask in discussions: https://github.com/kyoto-framework/kyoto/discussions
  - write directly to `yurii.zinets@icloud.com` or `info@kyoto.codes`
